# Preprint Posting

*Review Commons* requires authors to post their manuscript on a preprint server. In exchange, all the journals affiliated with *Review Commons* will provide authors with scooping protection from the date of posting of the preprint. 

If you already have posted your manuscript as a preprint on bioRxiv, please indicate its doi below. This is important to avoid creating duplicate preprints.

If you do not have a preprint yet, Review Commons will post the manuscript on your behalf prior to transferring the manuscript to an affiliate journal.

Please note that once a preprint is posted it can only be updated but not withdrawn.

Please enter the information requested below. Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*).
