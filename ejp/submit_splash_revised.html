      Now that you have received the reviews back from Review Commons, you will be able to instruct Review Commons to post the reviews to bioRxiv/medRxiv and to submit the manuscript with its reviews to one of the affiliate journals.
    </p>
    <p class=" ">
      The next steps in the <i>Review Commons</i> process are the following:
      <ol type="disc">
        <li>
          There are 2 choices to submit a revision and a response to the reviewers (see details: https://www.reviewcommons.org/authors/#affiliate):
          <ul>
            <li>upload within *four weeks* a *preliminary revision* accompanied by a *revision plan* (download template: https://reviewcommons.org/templates/revision-plan.docx). Please use this template when submitting your preliminary revision: 
            <li>or, *request more time* via email to perform a *full revision* (template: http://reviewcommons.org/templates/full-revision.docx). Please use this template when submitting your full revision.
          </ul>
          <p>
            This document will be useful to the editors who will make a decision based on the transferred <i>Review Commons reviews</i>. You can also upload an additional initial revision of the manuscript with all track changes visible. The original file cannot be modified at this stage and will be automatically forwarded to the affiliate journal for their reference.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          When submitting your revision, the system will required you to <strong>post it as a preprint</strong>, if this has not yet be done before. As of August 1, 2021, posting of the preprint is mandatory before transferring your manuscript to an affiliated journals. *Please note: only the preprint will posted. Posting of the reviews remains optional.*
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Posting of the reviews on bioRxiv/medRxiv:</strong> we strongly encourage the posting of your reviews and your response. You will be asked for the DOI of your preprint, or you can create a preprint. To post your response alongside the reviews you will be asked to copy and paste the content of your response letter in a dedicated text box.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transfer to affiliate journals:</strong> once the initial response to reviewers/revision plan has been uploaded, you will be able to access a screen that lets you select the affiliate journal to which you want to submit you manuscript with its reviews and response letter. Please note that the full set of reviews will be transferred by the system as well as your response and the original manuscript. If you elected to upload an initial revision, it will be transferred alongside the original version.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evaluation at affiliates:</strong>upon transfer, the recipient journal will consider the manuscript as a formal submission and use the transferred reviews and your response/revision plan to make an initial decision. <strong>Note that while it is under consideration at an affiliate journal, the manuscript cannot be transferred to any other affiliates.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>New rounds of transfer</strong>: if the journal declines, you will be informed by the journal. The manuscript will then be unlocked on the Review Commons site so that you can initiate a new transfer. <strong> Please note that the maximal number of transfer is limited to 4 rounds.</strong>
        </li>
      </ol>
