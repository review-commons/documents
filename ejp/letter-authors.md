NEXT STEPS:

1. REVISION & RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS: There are 2 choices (see details: https://www.reviewcommons.org/authors/#submitting-to-affiliate):
    - upload within *four weeks* a *preliminary revision* accompanied by a *revision plan* (download template: https://reviewcommons.org/templates/revision-plan.docx). Please use this template when submitting your preliminary revision.
    - or, *request more time* via email to perform a *full revision* (download template: https://reviewcommons.org/templates/full-revision.docx). Please use this template when submitting your full revision.

2. POSTING A REPLY ON BIORXIV or MEDRXIV: We strongly encourage the posting of a reply to the reviews on BioRxiv and MedRxiv. You will be able to instruct Review Commons to post your response to the reviewers alongside your preprint and the reviews. Please note that the reviews will be posted alongside the preprint at the time of the first transfer to a journal. Read our announcement: https://www.reviewcommons.org/blog/new-policy-review-commons-makes-preprint-peer-review-fully-transparent/

3. TRANSFER TO AFFILIATE JOURNALS: When you submit the preliminary/full revision, you will be presented with our Transfer Dashboard that allows you to select the affiliate journal to which you want to submit. Please note that the full set of reviews will be transferred alongside your response (revision plan or full revision) and the (preliminarily or fully) revised manuscript.

4. EVALUATION AT AFFILIATES: Upon transfer, the recipient journal will consider the manuscript as a formal submission and use the transferred reviews and your response/revision plan to make an initial decision. Note that while it is under consideration at an affiliate journal, the manuscript cannot be transferred to any other affiliates. 

5. NEW ROUND OF TRANSFER: If the first journal declines, you will be directly informed by this journal. The manuscript will then be unlocked on the Review Commons site so that you can initiate up to three additional rounds of transfer.

Please consult our detailed Guidelines for further details on the process and policies of {$journal_name} at https://reviewcommons.org/authors. If you have any further questions, please contact me directly.
 
Thank you again for sending us your work. We hope you will find the reviews useful and that Review Commons helps to disseminate your peer-reviewed research faster and more efficiently. 
 
Best wishes,
