{$corr_auth_full_addr}
 
Dear Dr. {$addressee_last_nm},
 
Thank you for sending your manuscript entitled “{\$ms_title}” to {$journal_name}. We have now completed the peer review of the manuscript. Please find the full set of reports below.

Note: in case you have questions about the content of the reviews or about the next steps, please just let us know by return email and we will schedule an appointment.

**Update to Review Commons preprint posting policy**
As of 1 August 2021, Review Commons will require all manuscripts to be posted as a preprint on either bioRxiv or medRxiv *prior to transfer to an affiliate journal*. In return, all the affiliate journals provide authors with scooping protection from the date of posting of the preprint (see detailed guidelines: ). Please note that posting your reviews and your responses (refereed preprint) remains optional.

If you have not yet posted your manuscript as a preprint at the time of transfer to an affiliate, you will have the option to do so via the Review Commons submission system.

To access your manuscript online and proceed to the next steps, please use the link below:

NEXT STEPS:

1. REVISION & RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS: There are 2 choices (see details: https://www.reviewcommons.org/authors/#affiliate):
    - upload within *four weeks* an *preliminary revision* accompanied by a *revision plan* (download template: reviewcommons.org/templates/revision-plan.docx). Please use this template when submitting your preliminary revision: 
    - or, *request more time* via email to perform a *full revision* (template: http://reviewcommons.org/templates/full-revision.docx). Please use this template when submitting your full revision:

2. POSTING THE PREPRINT: when submitting your revision, the system will required you to post it as a preprint, if this has not yet be done before. Posting of the preprint is mandatory before transferring your manuscript to an affiliated journals. *Please note: only the preprint will posted. Posting of the reviews remains optional.*

4. REVIEWS ON BIORXIV or MEDRXIV: We strongly encourage the posting of your reviews on BioRxiv and MedRxiv. You will be able to instruct Review Commons to post the reviews and your response alongside your preprint. Please follow the instructions that are provided online on the submission screen.

5. TRANSFER TO AFFILIATE JOURNALS: When you submit the preliminary/full revision, you will be presented with a screen (see screenshot: ) that allows you selecting the affiliate journal to which you want to submit. Please note that the full set of reviews will be transferred alongside your response (revision plan or full revision) and the (preliminarily or fully) revised manuscript.

6. EVALUATION AT AFFILIATES: Upon transfer, the recipient journal will consider the manuscript as a formal submission and use the transferred reviews and your response/revision plan to make an initial decision. Note that while it is under consideration at an affiliate journal, the manuscript cannot be transferred to any other affiliates. 

5. NEW ROUND OF TRANSFER: If the first journal declines, you will be directly informed by this journal. The manuscript will then be unlocked on the Review Commons site so that you can initiate up to two additional rounds of transfer.

Please consult our detailed Guidelines for further details on the process and policies of {$journal_name} at https://reviewcommons.org/authors . If you have any further questions, please contact me directly.
 
Thank you again for sending us your work. We hope you will find the reviews useful and the Review Commons helps to disseminate your peer-reviewed research faster and more efficiently.
